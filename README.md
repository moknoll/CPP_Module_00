# C++ Modules

This repository contains a series of modules designed to learn C++ programming. The modules cover the fundamental concepts of the language, from basic syntax to advanced topics like templates and the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Modules Overview

The modules are structured to provide a gradual learning curve. Each module focuses on a specific set of C++ concepts and includes several exercises to practice them.

### Module 00: Introduction to C++

-   **Namespaces**
-   **Classes and Objects**
-   **Member Functions**
-   **`this` Pointer**
-   **Initialization Lists**
-   **Static Members**
-   **File I/O**

### Module 01: Memory Allocation, Pointers, and References

-   **`new` and `delete`**
-   **Pointers and References**
-   **File I/O**
-   **`switch` statement**

### Module 02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, and Canonical Classes

-   **Canonical Class Form (Coplien's Form)**
-   **Constructors and Destructors**
-   **Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator**
-   **Operator Overloading**
-   **Fixed-Point Numbers**

### Module 03: Inheritance

-   **Single Inheritance**
-   **Multiple Inheritance**
-   **Virtual Inheritance (Diamond Problem)**
-   **Access Specifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`)**

### Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

-   **Abstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions**
-   **Interfaces**
-   **Virtual Destructors**
-   **Polymorphism**

### Module 05: Exceptions and the Standard Template Library (STL)

-   **`try`, `catch`, `throw`**
-   **Exception Safety**
-   **Introduction to the STL**
-   **Containers (e.g., `vector`, `list`, `map`)**
-   **Iterators**
-   **Algorithms**

## Compilation

Each exercise has its own `Makefile`. To compile an exercise, navigate to its directory and run:

```bash
make
```

This will create an executable for that exercise.
